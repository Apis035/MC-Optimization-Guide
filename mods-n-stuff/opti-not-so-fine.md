# A short note on OptiFine
As you may have noticed, OptiFine is only present on one modlist, the 1.12.2 one. Now, [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/1bjc5mc/is_there_a_reason_why_people_still_use_optifine/) [topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/17qij4g/is_optifine_that_bad_nowadays/) [has](https://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/187djkg/what_is_up_with_optifine_and_why_does_it_get_so/) [been](https://web.archive.org/web/20201029070752/https://gist.github.com/jellysquid3/e46882e37907dfbb3d03d26f589b1c6a/) [beaten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqXF4GgP9e0) [to](https://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/wyyymx/stop_using_optifine_goddamit/) [death](https://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/12qpidr/is_optifine_that_bad/), so I'll just list the reasons why:

- It has terrible mod compatibility in 1.16+
- It doesn't have native support for Fabric or NeoForge
- It tends to increase loading times, especially in modded environments
- It takes really long to update to newer versions of Minecraft
- There are better performance boosting mods out there
- Some of its' features can break certain game mechanics (for example Fast Math or Smooth World)

In the case of 1.12.2, there is [Vintagium](https://github.com/Asek3/sodium-1.12), but it's still W.I.P. and has compatibility issues. Once this changes, OptiFine (and presumably Nothirium too) will be removed from the 1.12.2 list.
