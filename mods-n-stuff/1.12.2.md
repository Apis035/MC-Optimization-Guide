## Cleanroom Loader

**NOTE:** Do not use MixinBooter/MixinBootstrap and ConfigAnytime! They're not necessary on Cleanroom.

| Mod | Notes | Client/Server |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Alfheim Lighting Engine | Alfheim 1.6 requires a build of Cleanroom Loader from GitHub Action, if you're using the latest release (0.2.4-alpha) you need Alfheim 1.5 | Server |
| CensoredASM | - | Both |
| Entity Culling | There are 2 mods going by that name, the one I'd recommend is by tr7zw | Client |
| Fixeroo | - | Both |
| Nothirium | If you're using CensoredASM, install Naughthirium as well, otherwise animations won't work | Client |
| StellarCore | `ParallelModelLoader` must be disabled if using VintageFix. You can also enable `AlwaysDeferChunkUpdates`, `HUDCaching` and `NoGLError` | Both |
| UniversalTweaks | - | Both |
| VintageFix | - | Both |

NAUGHTHIRIUM NOTE:

Currently, Naughthirium only works with Nothirium 0.3.4 and RenderLib 1.3.5. 0.4.X WILL NOT WORK

If you're using OptiFine, you must use Naughthirium 2.1.0, if not. 1.0.3
