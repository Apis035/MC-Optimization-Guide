## Cleanroom Loader

**NOTE:** Do not use MixinBooter/MixinBootstrap and ConfigAnytime! They're not necessary on Cleanroom.

| Alfheim Lighting Engine | - | Server |
| CensoredASM | - | Both |
| Entity Culling | There are 2 mods going by that name, the one I'd recommend is by tr7zw. There is an edge case where Entity Culling can crash the game. See [this](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium/issues/2985) for more info | Client |

| Nothirium | If you're using CensoredASM, install Naughthirium as well, otherwise animations won't work | Client |

### Celeritas

Celeritas is a port of Embeddium to various versions, and it's currently easily obtainable for 1.12.2 via Kappa Maintainer's repo: https://github.com/kappa-maintainer/Celeritas-auto-build/releases.

Current known incompatibilities:
- Chunk Animator
- LittleTiles
- Nothirium
- OptiFine
- Vintagium and its' forks (Relictium, Neonium)

Shader support isn't currently available, however it is W.I.P.

Unlike previous Sodium ports, this one **requires** Cleanroom Loader (or lwjgl3ify-colorful, but it has worse mod compatibility so I can't recommend it) and won't work on Forge.
