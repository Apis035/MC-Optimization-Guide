## Cleanroom Loader

**NOTE:** Do not use MixinBooter/MixinBootstrap and ConfigAnytime! They're not necessary on Cleanroom.

| Mod | Notes | Client/Server |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Alfheim Lighting Engine | Alpha 1.6-Dev.2 doesn't download Red Core automatically, you must do it yourself | Server |
| CensoredASM | - | Both |
| Entity Culling | There are 2 mods going by that name, the one I'd recommend is by tr7zw. There is an edge case where Entity Culling can crash the game. See [this](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium/issues/2985) for more info | Client |
| Fixeroo | See https://github.com/Radk6/MC-Optimization-Guide/issues/49. Until that gets fixed, Clumps are a good substitute | Both |
| Nothirium | If you're using CensoredASM, install Naughthirium as well, otherwise animations won't work | Client |
| StellarCore | `ParallelModelLoader` must be disabled if using VintageFix. You can also enable `AlwaysDeferChunkUpdates`, `HUDCaching` and `NoGLError` | Both |
| UniversalTweaks | - | Both |
| VintageFix | - | Both |
