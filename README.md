# MC-Optimization-Guide
Heavily inspired by [UsefulMods](https://github.com/TheUsefulLists/UsefulMods/blob/main/README.md) and [Minecraft-Performance-Flags-Benchmarks](https://github.com/Mukul1127/Minecraft-Performance-Flags-Benchmarks)
This guide only covers performance mods that are deemed "necessary", so mods that do the same thing (eg. Rubidium and Embeddium, Radon and Starlight, etc.) won't be included. Same goes for mods that may cause issues or break Vanilla parity.
