# MC-Optimization-Guide

The end-all, be-all optimization guide for various Minecraft versions.

**NOTE:**
This guide only covers performance mods that are deemed "necessary", so duplicate mods that do the same thing (eg. Rubidium and Embeddium, Radon and Starlight, etc.) won't be included. Same goes for mods that may cause issues or break Vanilla parity.

It also takes a fairly minimalist approach. This means that while there may be a way to squeeze a couple fps more with additional mods, the mods listed here should be more than enough for smooth and lag-free gameplay.
