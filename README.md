# MC-Optimization-Guide

The end-all, be-all optimization guide for various Minecraft versions.

**NOTE:**
This guide only covers performance mods that are deemed "necessary", so duplicate mods that do the same thing (eg. Rubidium and Embeddium, Radon and Starlight, etc.) won't be included. Same goes for mods that may cause issues or break Vanilla parity.

Heavily inspired by [UsefulMods](https://github.com/TheUsefulLists/UsefulMods/blob/main/README.md) and [Minecraft-Performance-Flags-Benchmarks](https://github.com/Mukul1127/Minecraft-Performance-Flags-Benchmarks)
