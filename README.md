# MC-Optimization-Guide

The end-all, be-all optimization guide for various Minecraft versions.

**NOTE:**
This guide only covers performance mods that are deemed "necessary", so duplicate mods that do the same thing (eg. Rubidium and Embeddium, Radon and Starlight, etc.) won't be included.

It also takes a fairly minimalist approach. This means that while there may be a way to squeeze out a couple fps more with additional mods, the mods listed here should be more than enough for smooth and lag-free gameplay.

Inspired by [UsefulMods](https://github.com/TheUsefulLists/UsefulMods) and various Reddit threads, as well as my own testing.
